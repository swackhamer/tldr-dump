# dvc-unfreeze

> Unfreeze stages in the DVC pipeline. This allows DVC to start tracking changes in stage dependencies again after they were frozen. See also: `dvc freeze`. More information: <https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/unfreeze>.

## Examples

### Unfreeze one or more specified stages

```bash
dvc unfreeze stage_name1 stage_name2 ...
```
