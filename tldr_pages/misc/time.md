# time

> Measure how long a command took to run. Note: `time` can either exist as a shell builtin, a standalone program or both. See also: `times`. More information: <https://manned.org/time>.

## Examples

### Run the `command` and print the time measurements to `stdout`

```bash
time command
```

### Create a very simple stopwatch (only works in Bash)

```bash
time read
```
