# xzmore

> Display text from `xz` or `lzma` compressed files. Almost equivalent to `xzless`, except it respects the `PAGER` environment variable, uses `more` by default and you cannot pass options to the pager. More information: <https://manned.org/xzmore>.

## Examples

### View a compressed file

```bash
xzmore path/to/file
```
