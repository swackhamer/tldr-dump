# mpg321

> High Performance MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 Audio Player for Layer 1, 2, and 3. Mpg321 was written (sometime in 1999) to be a drop-in replacement for the (previously) non-free mpg123 player. More information: <https://manned.org/mpg321>.

## Examples

### Play an audio source exactly `n` times (0 means forever)

```bash
mpg321 [-l|--loop] n path/to/file_a|URL path/to/file_b|URL ...
```

### Play a directory recursively

```bash
mpg321 -B path/to/directory
```

### Enable Basic Keys ( `*` or `/` - Increase or decrease volume, `n` - Skip song, `m` - Mute/unmute.) while playing

```bash
mpg321 -K path/to/file_a|URL path/to/file_b|URL ...
```

### Play files randomly until interrupted

```bash
mpg321 [-Z|--random] path/to/file_a|URL path/to/file_b|URL ...
```

### Shuffle the files before playing them once

```bash
mpg321 [-z|--shuffle] path/to/file_a|URL path/to/file_b|URL ...
```

### Play all files in the current directory and subdirectories, randomly (until interrupted), with Basic Keys enabled

```bash
mpg321 -B [-Z|--random] -K .
```
